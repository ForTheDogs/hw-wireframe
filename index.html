<h1>Backgound</h1>
<p>I grow up in Paramus, New Jersey.  As a kid my friends and I rode bikes, played sports, and were outside most of the time traversing the town.  In the winter we'd make snowmen, build forts out of snow,  have snowball fights, and sled down down the relatively steep street at the end of my block.  I played football in high school, enjoyed English and History, and bassically had a positive feeling about my four years there.
Went to the University of Maine for a year, majored in beer and other intoxicating beverages and left with a less then stellar GPA. A short time later I went to Johnson &Wales College(University) and majored in Hospitality Mgmt.  Earned my Associates degree, found I was not the perma-grinning front desk type, met my wife and departed J&W. 
I was married in 1989, moved to Florida in '90, and have lived here ever since. </p>

<h1>Family</h1>
<p>As stated above, I married my lovely wife, Kathleen, in 1989. She has recently become the Assistant Director of Catering at the Gaylord Palms, and has been with them since they opened. We have two wonderful children, a son, Michael, age 20, who is studying Architecture here at UCF and works at Universal, and a soon to be 18 yr old daughter, who works as a sports trainer at West Orange HS, models, works at Disney, and wants to be a Pastry Chef. I have two dogs, Spartacus, a rescued 9-11yr old Golden mix, and Buster, a rescued 5 yr old German Sheperd mix</p>
